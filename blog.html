									<h2 class="major">Going from Zero to Hero</h2>
									<p style="font-size:19px;">Over the years, I've developed a few set of strategies that greatly improved my chances of landing an internship.
										In this two-part series, I generalize a little bit of my personal experience and talk about proven strategies for
										applying and interviewing. My objective is to focus on some of the things that I do differently in my
										career search; more specifically, I mention unique points that really helped me and my peers
										out-information that I couldn't find elsewhere. Just to establish credibility, I’ve received over 40
										offers from companies/organizations such as Amazon, Walmart Labs, NSA, Nasdaq, JPMorgan, etc. I’m no
										where close to being considered a genius. All I’ve done to attain all these offers was to have a
										positive attitude and and follow a set of proven, yet unique, strategies. I’ve detailedly elaborated
										on these strategies for any candidate to succeed in his or her internship search. I call them the
										<i><strong>8 Critical Elements to a Successful Candidate</strong></i>. Without wasting time, here is a little about me:</p>

										<h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>I didn’t have any software engineering experience prior to first internship.
												My most advanced knowledge in computer science was creating a <i>for-loop</i> statement.</strong></li>
											<li>I don’t go to an ivy league university. I attend a local commuter school.</li>
											<li>I don't have a competitive GPA. I am no genius at all.</li>
											<li>I did not spend a penny for any premium career services or tutoring.</li>
										</ul>
									<p style="font-size:19px;">I've aggregated a few <i>hacks</i> that I've noticed during my career search and formulated them a complete set of proven
										strategies to land the tech position of your dreams. If you <strong>haven't applied to any positions yet</strong>, <strong>aren't receiving any call-backs</strong>, or <strong>want to aim high for the internships
										at the top tech companies</strong>, then these articles are for you.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Where to Start</h2>
									<p style="font-size:19px;">If you are completely new to your job search or want to receive more call-backs, then I'd <strong>start off with the first article</strong>. Once you've <i>hacked</i> a solid portfolio together
										with the <i><strong>8 Critical Elements to a Successful Candidate</strong></i> and are familiar with the rigor of
									coding challenges, then you're ready for the big leagues. Read the second article to completely change your career landscape with digital networking. All you need is a LinkedIn account.</p>
